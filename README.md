# LandensTimeCMD-Beta
So you’re that lazy huh?  You came to my repository because you’re so lazy that you can’t just drag you cursor to the bottom of your screen to check the time.  Well, you’ve come to the right place.
## What is this?
This is literally just a linux command that tells you the time.  Whether its your specific timezone or not.  Why are you even reading this still.  The time could be wrong for all you know.
